# Hang_Man
A fun guessing word game. The system chooses a word randomly from the list given to it. 
The game starts with display of number of letters in the word denoted by a blank space. 
The person playing the game needs to guess the word by guessing one letter of the word at a time.
For each right guess the letter will be displayed but if a wrong guess is made there is a small animation thing like a person is going to hang in the rope. 
For each wrong guess the man will proceed to hang and once we have reached the guess limit the game is over stating you are dead!. 
This repository consists of:
1. A list of word file.
2. Hangman.py the logical work of the game.
3. hangman_ani has small text acting as image for the step by step hangman.
